# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

I learned about the AWS CLI for the first time and had to set it up in my gitpod environment

**Installing AWS CLI**
I used the following command to update my gitpod environment

```
tasks:
  - name: aws-cli
    env:
      AWS_CLI_AUTO_PROMPT: on-partial
    init: |
      cd /workspace
      curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
      unzip awscliv2.zip
      sudo ./aws/install
      cd $THEIA_WORKSPACE_ROOT
      
  ```
